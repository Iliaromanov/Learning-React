# Learning-React

<!-- 
Notes:
- in package.json "devDependencies" is only for local dev
- .ts is used for plain typescript files and .tsx is used for react components 
- File structure:
    - public folder is for publicly visible assets


- for the first-react-app tutorial I'll use function based components since
  that is what is popular now due to being more concise.
  Class based components can be found in older code


- `export default` can be used on a single value per module to create a default export
  other exports must be named exports and need to be put in '{ }' when exporting/importing
  while the default export doesnt 

- React only allows a component to return a single html element
 if want to return multiple elements, can import Fragment from 'react' and wrap your 
 elements in that or just put empty angle brackets - '<>' and react will interperet that
 as a fragment
